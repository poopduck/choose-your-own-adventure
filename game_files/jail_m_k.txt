You're in the jail cell. Again, a single lightbulb hangs from the ceiling. You cannot see outside the metal bars, as 
it is too dark outside. You notice what appears to be a small hole near the back of the room that you might be able to 
squeeze into. What do you do?
(1) Check the door of the jail cell.
(2) Enter the hole
(3) Investigate the room
