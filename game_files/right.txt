You choose the right path and continue to run with the dragon right behind you. You reach the end of the path, 
but unfortunately realize that it is a dead end. However, you see what appears to be a sword lying on the ground 
a few feet away from you. What will you do?
(1) Try and pick up the sword
(2) Turn around and punch the dragon
