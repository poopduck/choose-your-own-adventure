However, you soon remember your hand is broken from the earlier encounter and your attack does more damage to you than 
it does to the dragon. As you fall on the ground rolling in pain, the dragon takes pity on you. He picks you up and 
takes you back to the dungeon. He nurses you back to health and you two soon become close friends. You live out the 
rest of your days chilling in the dungeon with your dragon buddy.

THE END :)
