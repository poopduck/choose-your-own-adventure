You enter the hole and find that it is actually a tunnel. As you go through it, you emerge into another room. Again 
there appears to be a hole in the back of the room that you might be able to squeeze into, although it seems 
significantly smaller than the other one. Other than the tunnel you just emerged from and the hole in the back, 
there appears to be no other entrances or exits.
(1) Enter the hole
(2) Further investigate the room
(3) Return the way you came from to the first room
