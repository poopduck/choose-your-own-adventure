You turn around and swing your fist wildly at the dragon. You somehow hit the dragon squarely in the snout, 
stunning it for a while. As it is dazed, you run past it and backtrack away from the dead end, instead 
taking the left path. At the end of the path, you find a steel door and successfully open it. It leads outside. 
The dragon tries to follow you, but it cannot fit through the door frame.

Congratulations! You have succesfully escaped!
