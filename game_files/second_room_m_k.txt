You're in the second room. Again, there is a hole in the back of the room that you might be able to squeeze into, 
although it seems significantly smaller than the other one. Other than the tunnel you just emerged from and the hole in the back, there appears to be no other entrances or exits.
(1) Enter the hole
(2) Further investigate the room
(3) Return the way you came from to the first room
