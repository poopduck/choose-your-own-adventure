You successfully pick up the sword and turn around in the nick of time, slashing the dragon's neck 
and slaying it in an epic matter. With the dragon dead, you backtrack away from the dead end and instead 
take the left path. At the end of the path, you find a steel door and successfully open it. It leads outside. 

Congratulations! You have succesfully escaped!
